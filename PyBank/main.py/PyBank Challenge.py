# PyBank Challenge

#Let's import the necessary modules to read and utilize csv files

import os
import csv

#Set up a filepath that references the budget_data.csv

print("hello world")
#Open and read budget_data.csv


#Write a script that analyzes/calculates the following:  
#Total number of months included in the dataset
    

#The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

#The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period,
#and then averages those changes

#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over entire period

#The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#Analysis must be printed to terminal AND exported to a txt file
